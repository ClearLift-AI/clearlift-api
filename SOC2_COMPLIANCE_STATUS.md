## Audit Logging Implementation

### Tables Created

1. **`audit_logs`** - General API activity
   - All requests logged with user, action, resource, result
   - Performance metrics tracked
   - Request correlation via request_id

2. **`auth_audit_logs`** - Authentication events
   - Login/logout tracking
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - OAuth connections

3. **`data_access_logs`** - Data queries
   - Tracks what data was accessed
   - PII access flagged
   - Export tracking

4. **`config_audit_logs`** - Configuration changes
   - All settings modifications
   - Old/new values tracked
   - Approval workflow support

5. **`security_events`** - Security incidents
   - SQL injection attempts
   - Rate limit violations
   - Unauthorized access attempts

### Audit Queries for Compliance

```sql
-- Show all user actions in last 30 days
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE user_id = ? AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-30 days')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Show failed authentication attempts
SELECT * FROM auth_audit_logs
WHERE success = 0 AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-24 hours')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Show data exports
SELECT * FROM data_access_logs
WHERE export_format IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Show security incidents requiring review
SELECT * FROM security_events
WHERE manual_review_required = 1 AND reviewed_at IS NULL
ORDER BY severity DESC, timestamp DESC;
```

## Security Controls

### Rate Limiting
- **Standard**: 100 requests/minute per user
- **Auth**: 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes
- **Analytics**: 20 requests/minute
- **Exports**: 10 per hour

### Security Headers
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Input Protection
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS prevention via HTML entity encoding
- Null byte removal
- Content-Type validation

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring
- Worker health: `/v1/workers/health`
- Queue status: `/v1/workers/queue/status`
- Failed jobs: `/v1/workers/dlq`

### Security Monitoring
```sql
-- Critical security events in last hour
SELECT COUNT(*) as critical_events
FROM security_events
WHERE severity = 'critical'
  AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-1 hour');

-- Brute force detection
SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM auth_audit_logs
WHERE success = 0
  AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-15 minutes')
GROUP BY ip_address
HAVING attempts > 3;

-- Unusual data access patterns
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as queries
FROM data_access_logs
WHERE timestamp > datetime('now', '-5 minutes')
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING queries > 50;
```

## Data Retention

### Default Retention Periods
- **Audit Logs**: 365 days (1 year minimum for SOC 2)
- **Configuration Changes**: 730 days (2 years)
- **Security Events**: 1095 days (3 years)
- **Sessions**: 30 days
- **OAuth States**: 24 hours

### Automated Cleanup
```sql
-- Cleanup jobs tracked
SELECT * FROM cleanup_jobs
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check retention policy
SELECT * FROM audit_retention_policy;
```

## Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply audit log tables
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

### ✅ Required Secrets
```bash
npx wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY        # For field encryption
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY   # Backend access
npx wrangler secret put R2_SQL_TOKEN          # Analytics access
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID      # OAuth
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET  # OAuth
npx wrangler secret put FACEBOOK_APP_ID       # OAuth
npx wrangler secret put FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET   # OAuth
```

### ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Test Audit Logging**
```bash
# Make API request
curl https://api.clearlift.ai/v1/health

# Check audit log
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
```

2. **Test Rate Limiting**
```bash
# Exceed rate limit
for i in {1..101}; do curl https://api.clearlift.ai/v1/health; done
# Should get 429 after 100 requests
```

3. **Test Security Headers**
```bash
curl -I https://api.clearlift.ai/v1/health
# Should see all security headers
```

## Compliance Evidence

### For Auditors

1. **Audit Trail**: Query `audit_logs` for any time period
2. **Access Control**: Check `organization_members` for RBAC
3. **Data Encryption**: Review `platform_connections.credentials_encrypted`
4. **Security Events**: Query `security_events` for incidents
5. **Retention**: Check `audit_retention_policy` for compliance

### Sample Compliance Queries

```sql
-- Evidence of access control
SELECT u.email, om.role, o.name as organization
FROM users u
JOIN organization_members om ON u.id = om.user_id
JOIN organizations o ON om.organization_id = o.id
WHERE u.id = ?;

-- Evidence of encryption
SELECT
  id,
  platform,
  CASE WHEN credentials_encrypted IS NOT NULL THEN 'ENCRYPTED' END as credentials_status,
  CASE WHEN refresh_token_encrypted IS NOT NULL THEN 'ENCRYPTED' END as token_status
FROM platform_connections;

-- Evidence of audit logging
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed
FROM audit_logs
WHERE timestamp > datetime('now', '-30 days')
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
